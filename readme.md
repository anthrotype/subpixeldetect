# Detect Subpixel Font Rendering

Small javascript for checking if DirectWrite is active on the current browser. Might also identify other font rendering methods that are able to deal with subpixels.

It was primarily meant to detect if Firefox on Windows 7 uses DirectWrite or GDI as font rendering method. Under different OS/browsers this script might be buggy. Help and feedback is always appreciated!
